# VtkDiff

Numerical comparison of data arrays in vtk files.

For comparison of numerical simulation results with analytical solutions
or previous runs the [numdiff](http://www.nongnu.org/numdiff/) software
is a popular choice. We use VTK data formats to store simulation data and
the vtkdiff tool shall provide means of numerical comparison of different
data arrays similar to those available in the numdiff software.
